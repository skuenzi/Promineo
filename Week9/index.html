              <h2>After Six, Yosemite Valley</h2>
              <p>This was such a fun climb, but so much harder than expected. The first pitch, which has a polished crack system, is supposed to be 5.7. Hardest 5.7 I've ever climbed. I took two newbies up this climb and one of them cried. Which is understandable. But now she's totally into climbing so it's fine.</p>

              <h2>Olive Oil, Red Rocks Canyon</h2>
              <p>I've climbed this twice. The first time was horrifying (climbing with an inexperienced follower in the dark, running out of rope, the climb itself really run-out). The second time was really fun. It's got great exposure and some really fun moves.</p>

              <h2>Southeast Arete, Baboquivari Peak</h2>
              <p>This was QUITE the adventure. It was incredibly fun, but exhausting. The hike down in the dark was difficult, to put it nicely. But overall, a really cool experience. </p>
