          <h2>After Six, Yosemite Valley</h2>
          <p>
            This was such a fun climb, but so much harder than expected. The
            first pitch, which has a polished crack system, is supposed to be
            5.7. Hardest 5.7 I've ever climbed. I took two newbies up this climb
            and one of them cried. Which is understandable. But now she's
            totally into climbing so it's fine.

            I've climbed this twice. The first time was horrifying (climbing
            with an inexperienced follower in the dark, running out of rope, the
            climb itself really run-out). The second time was really fun. It's
            got great exposure and some really fun moves.

            This was QUITE the adventure. It was incredibly fun, but exhausting.
            The hike down in the dark was difficult, to put it nicely. But
            overall, a really cool experience.
